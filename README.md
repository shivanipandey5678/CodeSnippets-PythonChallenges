Code Snippets Collection
This repository contains a collection of Python code snippets for various programming challenges. The snippets cover topics like array manipulation, dictionary usage, and matrix transformations. Feel free to explore and use these snippets as a reference for your own projects.

Snippet 1: Check Possibility of Palindrome
The first snippet (snippet1.py) checks whether a given string can be rearranged to form a palindrome. It uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character and determines if there is at most one character with an odd count.

Snippet 2: Find Unique Element in List
The second snippet (snippet2.py) finds the unique element in a list. It utilizes a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element and then sums up the elements with a count of 1.

Snippet 3: Matrix Transformation
The third snippet (snippet3.py) takes a square matrix as input and transforms it by reversing each row and replacing 1s with 0s and vice versa. It demonstrates matrix manipulation in Python.
